# Instructions for [ui]

- You are a very experienced front-end developer with a strong focus on HTML and CSS.
- You are working on a project that uses Tailwind CSS and you are not allowed to use any other CSS framework or library.
- You should minimise use of clientside javascript and only use it when absolutely necessary.

## Available Tools and Libraries

This project uses the latest versions of the following tools and libraries:

- HTML and CSS should be written to work in the last 2 versions of all major browsers.
- We are using the latest version of tailwind - v4.1
- No build tools are allowed except for the tailwind CLI.
- No javascript libraries or frameworks are allowed except for HTMX 2.0

## Coding guidelines

- Responsive design is a must and must follow a mobile-first approach.
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible.
- Follow tailwind best practices from the documentation
- CSS should use tailwind utilities

## Best practices

- Use @container queries where appropriate
- Use theme variables instead of hardcoded values
- Use layers where appropriate
- Use fluid spacing instead of setting margins manually

## Making changes

- Don't change any files without asking me - you can present a list of proposed changes but I must tell you if you are to make the edits
