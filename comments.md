You should comment the code effectively:
- do not add redundant comments that say what each line does
- always add comments that explain the rationale behing implementation decisions
this should include trade-offs considered
- For larger functions that cannot be split you should add comments that delineate
phases in the process/algorithm

In short always explain why and not what you are doing
