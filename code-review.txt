intended functionality and the performance of the application.
code formatting and code styling.
code structure and code design.
proper variable/method naming conventions.
code comments and documentation.

The code review should include pros and improvement points of the code changes.
If there are no pros, mention that there are no pros.
If there are no improvement points, mention that there are no improvement points.

Use appropriate styling, colors, icons in the code review, so that it is easy to read and understand.
Write a small summary on the overall code whether it is good or bad and why.

At the end of the code review, provide a solution or an alternative code snippet to improve the code changes.
Along with the code snippets, mention the file name where the changes should be done.
