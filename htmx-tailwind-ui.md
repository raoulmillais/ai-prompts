Absolutely — here is the first curated prompt bank for Raoul, your experienced CTO and software engineer. It’s designed to match the same dynamic, high-level, and mentally stimulating tone we’ve built for you and Eleanor, but adapted for a deep technical mind with strategic oversight responsibilities.

⸻

🧠 Strategic Prompt Bank: CTO Series

Audience: Raoul – CTO, systems thinker, builder of resilient, elegant, and scalable architectures.

⸻

SECTION: Prompt Bank for Raoul (CTO / Technical Strategist / System Architect)

1. Architecture Risk Auditor

“Evaluate this [system/design/pattern] and identify its most likely points of failure under load, user abuse, or scaling stress. Propose first principles solutions, not just patches.”

→ Ideal for high-stakes infra decisions or reviewing legacy decisions with fresh eyes.

⸻

2. Codebase Soul Searcher

“Analyze this codebase or system architecture and describe what it says about the team’s culture, incentives, and engineering philosophy. What trade-offs are implicit in their choices?”

→ Combines technical reading with behavioral insight — turning architecture into narrative.

⸻

3. Dev Velocity Forensics

“Help me diagnose bottlenecks in our current product or engineering workflow. Where are we leaking creative or build energy? What metrics and qualitative signals should I watch?”

→ Mix of systems and human dynamics: great for improving cycle time and code-to-impact.

⸻

4. High-Leverage Engineer Identifier

“Based on our team structure and current growth stage, what specific skills or thinking patterns should I prioritize when hiring the next engineer? Where is my current blind spot?”

→ Use when planning senior hires, building pods, or auditing team capabilities.

⸻

5. Tech Stack Darwinism

“Assess our current tech stack and evolution strategy. Which parts are over-engineered, under-leveraged, or risk becoming legacy traps? Which areas need rethinking from first principles?”

→ For when scale introduces drag or when founders need to evolve beyond v1 foundations.

⸻

6. AI-Augmented Engineer Playbook

“Design a workflow where my engineers use AI agents (like GitHub Copilot, GPT, Claude) to 10x productivity without becoming code monkeys. What are the limits and superpowers of each?”

→ Critical for modern teams blending automation with craft.

⸻

7. Build-vs-Buy Provocateur

“Challenge me on a recent technical decision to build in-house instead of using a third-party or open-source tool. Where might ego, sunk cost, or over-ownership be biasing me?”

→ Perfect for technical leaders navigating scale, speed, and pride.

⸻

8. Strategic Refactor Advisor

“We’re planning a major refactor. Help me create a strategy that aligns with business outcomes, protects developer sanity, and creates storytelling artifacts to explain why this matters.”

→ Converts a dangerous project into a strategic narrative that wins exec buy-in.

⸻

9. Security Minimalist

“Review our current security posture. Where are we overcompensating for risk that doesn’t exist — and where are we underestimating risk that’s silently compounding?”

→ Encourages a bias toward realistic threat modeling over compliance theater.

⸻

10. Scalability Foresight Engine

“We’re seeing early growth in [feature/platform]. Project how it might break at 10x scale. What architectural, data, or team constraints will surface if we succeed faster than expected?”

→ Great for product/infra planning under uncertainty — pressure-testing upside.

Would you like me to:
	•	Package this into a visual prompt bank for Raoul (PDF, Notion template, etc)?
	•	Develop a “CTO Weekly Prompt Ritual” — a structured check-in for tech leaders to stay ahead of blind spots?
	•	Add “voice-to-prompt” templates so Raoul can just speak ideas and get structured AI outputs?

We could also build collaborative cross-over prompts between you, Eleanor, and Raoul — for example:
	•	Cross-domain diagnostic: “Evaluate this strategy from the POV of the founder, the CFO, and the CTO.”
	•	Multi-perspective friction resolver: “Where might technical constraints be at odds with business incentives — and how could we harmonize them?”
